# Pushdown Automata Simulator

## Introduction
The **Pushdown Automata (PDA) Simulator** is a tool designed to simulate the behavior of a pushdown automaton, which is a type of computational model used in formal language theory. It extends the capabilities of finite automata by incorporating a **stack**, allowing it to recognize a broader class of languages, specifically **context-free languages**.

## Features
- ✅ Simulates **deterministic and non-deterministic** pushdown automata.
- 📊 Visual representation of the **state transitions**.
- 🔧 Customizable **input alphabet, stack alphabet, and transition functions**.
- ⏳ Step-by-step execution to observe the **stack operations**.
- 🎯 Support for multiple **acceptance criteria** (final state or empty stack).

## Installation
To use the simulator, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pushdown-automata-simulator.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory
```sh
cd pushdown-automata-simulator
```

## Initial Commit
This project is being developed in **C++**, and currently, the initial setup is being prepared. Future updates will include:
- Implementation of **PDA simulation logic**.
- **Graphical or textual representation** of stack operations.
- Detailed **examples and test cases**.
